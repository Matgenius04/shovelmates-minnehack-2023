# Unit Testing

### Basic Usage
```bash
npm i
npm run apitest
```

For just showing the server response along with the test results (recommended), you can run
```bash
npm i
npm run apitest -- response
```

For a lotta debug information (shows the request body sent + server response), you can run
```bash
npm run apitest -- debug
```

Let me know if you'd like anything else added. So far the api testing is incomplete
